My work is primarily focused on the concept of "interaction," which encompasses the integration and application of virtual-physical interaction technologies. These technologies are designed to enable seamless collaboration between human partners and embodied intelligent robots, allowing them to operate and perform complex tasks in a wide variety of physical environments and locations. Through advanced interaction frameworks, human-robot teams can leverage existing tools and interfaces to execute a broad range of actions or movement tasks. This collaborative synergy enables the successful completion of operations that require precision, adaptability, and coordination in real-world scenarios, breaking down the traditional barriers between virtual and physical spaces. The aim is to create a dynamic, adaptable system where robots and humans can work together effortlessly, regardless of the environment or task at hand.

As a newcomer to academic research, I am eager to engage in discussions and exchanges with fellow researchers. I look forward to collaborating with others to collectively advance the era of embodied intelligence.<img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations">.

[Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Method for Microgrid Optimization Scheduling](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/12/9235)

**Jinke Yao**, Jiachen Xu, Ning Zhang, Yajuan Guan

[**Project**](https://github.com/Jackyyaojk/BoatController.git) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to the optimal scheduling problem of microgrids. During the training process, the current learned networks are used to assist Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in completing game history accumulation, and updating the learning network parameters to obtain optimal microgrid scheduling strategies and a simulated environmental dynamics model. We establish a microgrid environment simulator that includes Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, Photovoltaic (PV) systems, and Energy Storage (ES) systems for simulation.

[A Confidence-based Allocation Approach for USV Trajectory Tracking via Human-Robot Co-Drivin](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10673172)

**Jinke Yao**, Yingying Shao, Qinyuan Ren

[**Project**](https://github.com/Jackyyaojk/BoatController.git) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- a Human-Driving Co-driving framework to achieve the human-in-the loop control is proposed in our work. A nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework with nominal dynamic model will be solved for optimal tracking accuracy. And a confidence-based dynamic authority allocation method considering temporal stochastic driver model enable the flexible and efficient shared control.

[A Model Predictive Control Approach for USV Autonomous Cruising via Disturbance Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10591898)

Maotong Cheng, **Jinke Yao**, Qinyuan Ren

[**Project**](https://github.com/Jackyyaojk/BoatController.git) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- a learning-based model predictive control (MPC) approach for USV course-keeping subject to disturbances and uncertainties. A relatively simplified dynamics model is augmented by a long short term memory (LSTM) residual model, which can capture complicated hydrodynamics effect and eliminate model mismatch.
