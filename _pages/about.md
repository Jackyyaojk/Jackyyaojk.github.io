My research advances transfer learning for dexterous manipulation, enabling robots to generalize across embodiments, environments, and tasks. I develop methods that distill manipulation priors from diverse data sources and re-ground them in new physical contexts, allowing skills such as grasping, in-hand manipulation, and tool use to remain consistent despite changes in robot morphology, workspace conditions, or task objectives. The goal is to build versatile embodied agents capable of rapidly adapting fine-grained manipulation strategies to novel settings with minimal additional supervision.

As a newcomer to academic research, I am eager to engage in discussions and exchanges with fellow researchers. I look forward to collaborating with others to collectively advance the era of embodied intelligence.<img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations">.
